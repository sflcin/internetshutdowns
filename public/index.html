                Instances of Internet shutdowns in India are increasing at a worrisome pace. As the Internet is a key enabler of many fundamental rights, including freedom of speech and expression, such frequent disruptions have been a cause for concern. They threaten the democratic working of nations, and also point to the gradual normalization of the mindset that permits such blanket restriction on Internet access. As a part of this project, we track incidents of Internet shutdowns across India in at attempt to draw attention to the troubling trend of disconnecting access to Internet services. With this tracker, we aim to stand strong with the message that Internet is essential for the holistic socio-economic and cultural development of the country. #KeepItOn.
